# PhD Computer Vision

Practical implementations of Computer Vision techniques developed during my PhD studies.

## Overview

This repository contains applied projects exploring concepts, algorithms, and methodologies from my PhD research in Computer Vision. Each project is contained within its own directory and focuses on a specific technique or research question.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [instance-classification-comparison](./instance-classification-comparison/) | Comparison of YOLOv8 and Gemini Flash for facial emotion detection (Happy/Sad) utilizing Monte Carlo simulations and Wilcoxon statistical tests. | Complete |
| *Future projects will be listed here.* | | |

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains a dedicated `README.md` with specific setup, execution instructions, and methodology details. 

To set up the general environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/pedroandrade-tech/phd-computer-vision.git](https://github.com/pedroandrade-tech/phd-computer-vision.git)

# Navigate to a specific project
cd phd-computer-vision/instance-classification-comparison

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
